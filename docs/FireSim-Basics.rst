FireSim Basics
===================================

FireSim is a cycle-accurate, FPGA-accelerated scale-out computer system
simulation platform developed in the Berkeley Architecture Research Group in
the EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley.

FireSim is capable of simulating from **one to thousands of multi-core compute
nodes**, derived from **silicon-proven** and **open** target-RTL, with an optional
cycle-accurate network simulation tying them together. FireSim runs on FPGAs in **public
cloud** environments like AWS EC2 F1, removing the high capex traditionally
involved in large-scale FPGA-based simulation, as well as on on-premises FPGAs.

FireSim is useful both for datacenter architecture research as well as running
many single-node architectural experiments in parallel on FPGAs. By harnessing
a standardized host platform and providing a large amount of
automation/tooling, FireSim drastically simplifies the process of building and
deploying large-scale FPGA-based hardware simulations.

To learn more, see the `FireSim website <https://fires.im>`__ and the FireSim
`ISCA 2018 paper <https://sagark.org/assets/pubs/firesim-isca2018.pdf>`__.

For a two-minute overview that describes how FireSim simulates a datacenter,

Three common use cases:
--------------------------

Single-Node Simulation In Parallel Using On-Premises FPGAs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, FireSim allows for simulation of individual Rocket
Chip-based nodes without a network, which allows individual simulations to run
at ~150 MHz. The FireSim manager has the ability to automatically distribute
jobs to on-premises FPGAs allowing users to harness existing FPGAs for quick turnaround time and
maximum flexibility. For example, users can run all of SPECInt2017 on Rocket Chip
in ~1 day by running the 10 separate workloads in parallel on 10 on-premises FPGAs.

Single-Node Simulation In Parallel Using Cloud FPGAs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, FireSim allows for simulation of individual Rocket
Chip-based nodes without a network, which allows individual simulations to run
at ~150 MHz. The FireSim manager has the ability to automatically distribute
jobs to many parallel simulations running on cloud FPGAs, expediting the process of running large
workloads like SPEC. For example, users can run all of SPECInt2017 on Rocket Chip
in ~1 day by running the 10 separate workloads in parallel on 10 FPGAs hosted in the cloud.

Datacenter/Cluster Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, FireSim also models a cycle-accurate network with
parameterizeable bandwidth and link latency, as well as configurable
topology, to accurately model current and future datacenter-scale
systems. For example, FireSim has been used to simulate 1024 quad-core
Rocket Chip-based nodes, interconnected by a 200 Gbps, 2us network. To learn
more about this use case, see our `ISCA 2018 paper
<https://sagark.org/assets/pubs/firesim-isca2018.pdf>`__ or `two-minute lightning talk
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XwoSe5c8lY>`__.

Other Use Cases
---------------------

This release does not support a non-cycle-accurate network as our `AWS Compute Blog Post/Demo
<https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/bringing-datacenter-scale-hardware-software-co-design-to-the-cloud-with-firesim-and-amazon-ec2-f1-instances/>`__
used. This feature will be restored in a future release.

If you have other use-cases that we haven't covered, feel free to contact us!


Background/Terminology
---------------------------

   FireSim Infrastructure Diagram

**FireSim Manager** (``firesim``)
  This program (available on your path as ``firesim``
  once we source necessary scripts) automates the work required to launch FPGA
  builds and run simulations. Most users will only have to interact with the
  manager most of the time. If you're familiar with tools like Vagrant or Docker, the ``firesim``
  command is just like the ``vagrant`` and ``docker`` commands, but for FPGA simulators
  instead of VMs/containers.

**Manager Instance**
  This is the main host (ex. AWS EC2 instance or local machine) that you will
  SSH-into and do work on. This is where you'll clone your copy of FireSim and
  use the FireSim Manager to deploy builds/simulations from.

**Build Farm**
  These are instances that are managed by the FireSim manager when you run FPGA builds.
  The manager will automatically ship source for builds to these instances and
  run the Verilog -> FPGA Image process on them.

**Run Farm**
  These are a collection of instances that the manager
  manages and deploys simulations onto. You can use multiple
  Run Farms in parallel, to run multiple separate
  simulations in parallel.

To disambiguate between the computers being simulated and the computers doing
the simulating, we also define:

**Target**
  The design and environment under simulation. Generally, a
  group of one or more multi-core RISC-V microprocessors with or without a network between them.

**Host**
  The computers executing the FireSim simulation -- the **Run Farm** from above.

We frequently prefix words with these terms. For example, software can run
on the simulated RISC-V system (*target*-software) or on a host x86 machine (*host*-software).

**Golden Gate (MIDAS II)**
  The FIRRTL compiler used by FireSim to convert target RTL into a decoupled
  simulator. Formerly named MIDAS.
