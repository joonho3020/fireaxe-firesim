must also do (sudo all things along the sim/midas/src/main/cc/simif*.cc path):
 - sudo chmod a+rwX /sys/bus/pcie/devices/PCIE_EBDF/vendor
 - sudo chmod a+rwX /sys/bus/pcie/devices/PCIE_EBDF/device
 - sudo chmod a+rwX /sys/bus/pcie/devices/PCIE_EBDF/xdma/*_h2c_0

on aws require you do the same so you don't need sudo for driver/switches

must also install fpga-util from the platform area and make it sudo executable

sudo cp sudo-scripts/firesim-* /bin
